# Phase 1 Continuation Handoff

## Current State

You're at the **entry point** of Phase 1 (Data Foundation). All architecture decisions are locked and tested. Context has been compacted from 79% to ~20-25% (fresh session).

**Ready to:**
1. Plan Phase 1 using `/gsd:plan-phase`
2. Execute the plan with Ralph loop (`/execute-phase-with-ralph 1`)

---

## Completed Work (Previous Session)

### Navigation Architecture ✅
- Created dynamic `[workspaceSlug]/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`
- Fixed routing pattern: `/{slug}/{tab}` for workspace-scoped navigation
- Updated 6 components to use correct navigation paths
- Commit: a8f4e0e

### Context Engineering ✅
- Lowered trigger threshold from 60% → 50% remaining
- Fixed hook permissions: `chmod +x` on all `.js` and `.sh` hooks
- Metrics file will now write correctly
- Commit: b45fa12

### Autonomous Workflow Setup ✅
- Created "Phase Planning Strategy" in CLAUDE.md
  - Auto-triggers `/gsd:plan-phase` when user says "plan phase X"
- Created "Phase Execution Strategy" in CLAUDE.md
  - Auto-triggers `/execute-phase-with-ralph {PHASE_ID}` for autonomous execution
- Created new skill: `/execute-phase-with-ralph`
- Commits: 6187ff8, c73787f

### Session Memory Archive ✅
- Created `session-2026-02-26-context-compact.md`
- All decisions & learnings captured for future reference
- Session can be safely reset

---

## Work Remaining

### Task 1: Plan Phase 1 (Data Foundation)
```bash
/gsd:plan-phase
```
This will create `.planning/phases/01-data-foundation/PLAN.md` with:
- Detailed task breakdown
- Success criteria
- File changes needed
- Dependencies

You'll review and approve before execution.

### Task 2: Execute Phase 1 with Ralph Loop
```bash
/execute-phase-with-ralph 1
```
This will:
- Launch Ralph loop reading the PLAN.md
- Execute each task iteratively
- Run tests after each step
- Make atomic commits
- Continue until `<promise>PHASE COMPLETE</promise>`

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Autonomous workflow** | GSD for planning (detailed analysis), Ralph for execution (iterative self-correction) |
| **50% context threshold** | Earlier detection enables proactive compaction before crisis |
| **Workspace-scoped routing** | Clean separation: global tabs (`/tab`) vs workspace tabs (`/{slug}/tab`) |
| **Hook permissions** | Metrics file must be executable to enable auto-monitoring |

---

## No Blockers

- All setup complete ✅
- All commits pushed ✅
- Hooks fixed and ready ✅
- CLAUDE.md updated with automation ✅
- Context compacted and archived ✅

---

## Next Action

**Start here when resuming:**

1. Run `/gsd:plan-phase` to create Phase 1 plan
2. Review PLAN.md and approve
3. Run `/execute-phase-with-ralph 1` to execute autonomously
4. Monitor Ralph loop progress
5. Verify all tests pass and commits are atomic

---

## Context Restoration

If anything feels unclear:
- See `session-2026-02-26-context-compact.md` for full session decisions
- See CLAUDE.md Phase Planning/Execution Strategy sections
- See `/Users/arana/.claude/skills/execute-phase-with-ralph/skill.md` for Ralph skill details

**You're in great shape. Just run `/gsd:plan-phase` to begin Phase 1! 🚀**
