## Current State

✅ **Project initialization COMPLETE.** All foundational artifacts created and committed.

Ready to proceed to Phase 1 planning and execution.

## Completed Work

1. ✅ **Codebase Mapping** (.planning/codebase/ — 7 documents)
   - STACK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, CONCERNS.md
   - Commit: `e97e1c0`

2. ✅ **PROJECT.md** — Complete vision document
   - Multi-workspace AI orchestration platform
   - OpenClaw integration (bidirectional: polling + invocation)
   - Kanban board with ticket lifecycle (To-do → In Progress → PR Review → Done → Closed)
   - Cron job management (global view, per-workspace filtering, cross-workspace execution)
   - Activity logging, agent evaluation, per-workspace wiki
   - REST API-first architecture with standards (RFC 9457, versioning, pagination, auth)
   - Commit: `9fdbbab`

3. ✅ **Config.json** — YOLO mode, comprehensive planning, Opus models
   - Commit: `7678f20`

4. ✅ **Domain Research** (4 parallel agents)
   - STACK.md: REST API standards (RFC 9457, cursor pagination, zod-openapi, @convex-dev/workflow)
   - FEATURES.md: Feature landscape, dependencies, MVP recommendations
   - ARCHITECTURE.md: Component boundaries, build order (data → CRUD → engine → dispatch → UI), state machines
   - PITFALLS.md: 3 critical production bugs identified + prevention strategies
   - Commit: `3b386d4`

5. ✅ **REQUIREMENTS.md** — 47 v1 requirements across 9 domains
   - Workspace Management (WS-01 to WS-06)
   - Agent Registration (AG-01 to AG-06)
   - Ticket Management (TK-01 to TK-07)
   - Activity Logging (AC-01 to AC-05)
   - Metrics (MT-01 to MT-04)
   - Cron Jobs (CR-01 to CR-08)
   - Workflows (WF-01 to WF-06)
   - Wiki (WK-01 to WK-04)
   - OpenClaw Integration (OC-01 to OC-05)
   - REST API Standards (API-01 to API-12) — CRITICAL foundation
   - Critical Bug Fixes (BUG-01 to BUG-03)
   - Commit: `af8d7a8`

## Remaining Work

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (NEXT)
- Fix workspace isolation bypass (notifications.ts, executions.ts)
- Implement retry limits & timeouts
- Fix cost calculation silent $0 fallback
- Schema expansion: budget fields, immutable audit log, step-level data

### Phase 2-12: Following research recommendations
- API standardization (RFC 9457, versioning, pagination)
- Workflow engine integration (@convex-dev/workflow)
- Gateway dispatch (OpenClaw invocation)
- Notification & monitoring
- Observability UI

## Key Decisions Made

1. **REST API-first architecture** — All features via standard REST endpoints for agent consumption
2. **RFC 9457 error format** — Industry standard error responses
3. **Cursor-based pagination** — Better for real-time data
4. **@convex-dev/workflow adoption** — Instead of custom engine (noted beta risk)
5. **zod-openapi for OpenAPI spec** — Single source of truth
6. **Bidirectional OpenClaw integration** — Polling + invocation
7. **Per-workspace wiki in git** — PR-reviewed, versioned decisions

## Critical Blockers/Issues

None blocking Phase 1. All research complete, requirements defined, ready to plan and execute Phase 1.

## Research Insights for Phase Planning

**Phase 1 must address highest-density pitfalls:**
- Workspace isolation (CRIT-1): Found in production code — notifications.ts and executions.ts have no workspace scoping
- Cost governance (CRIT-3): calculateCost() returns $0 silently on misconfiguration
- Retry protection (CRIT-2): No max retry limits, no timeouts

**Build order from research:**
1. Data foundation (schema, workspace enforcement, budget fields, immutable audit)
2. CRUD operations (workflow mutations, approval gates)
3. Execution engine (advanceWorkflowStep loop, data chaining)
4. Gateway dispatch (action-based OpenClaw invocation)
5. Observability (dashboard, cost, audit viewer)

**Technology stack (from research):**
- RFC 9457 Problem Details format
- Cursor pagination helpers
- @convex-dev/workflow for DAG execution
- zod-openapi for OpenAPI generation
- Polling primary + webhook secondary for notifications

## Mental Context

Mission Control is a **multi-workspace orchestration platform** that manages chaos of scattered agent usage. The project has a solid foundational codebase (Convex + Next.js, 32 API routes, workflow validation, gateway integration). Research identified 3 critical production bugs that Phase 1 must fix before building new features.

The platform's value is **governance + visibility**: workspace isolation, cost tracking, activity logging, and agent evaluation. All features must be REST API-accessible so agents can consume them.

Next session should start with `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create the detailed plan for Phase 1 (Data Foundation). Phase 1 plan will address critical bugs + establish foundation for all subsequent phases.

## Next Action

Resume with:
```bash
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

This will create Phase 1 PLAN.md with:
- Task breakdown for data foundation
- Critical bug fixes
- Schema changes
- Success criteria
- Dependencies
