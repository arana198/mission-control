## Workflow Inefficiencies

### Task Creation Flow
Current: Click "+" → Fill 5+ fields → Save → Assign → Track
Optimal: Voice/text "Create X task for Y" → AI auto-fills & assigns

### Agent Assignment
Current: Open task → Click assignee → Select from dropdown → Save
Optimal: Drag task to agent card → Auto-assigns & notifies

## AI-Centric Improvements

### Suggested Automation
- Auto-suggest assignee based on workload
- Smart task routing based on agent capabilities
- Predictive ETA for task completion
- Auto-escalate stale tasks

### Smart Defaults
- Pre-fill priority based on keywords
- Auto-detect epic from task title
- Default assignee based on availability

### Predictive Delegation
- "You have 3 P0 tasks, want me to distribute?"
- Suggest task handoff when agent overloaded
- Auto-balance workload every 30 minutes

## Strategic Redesign Suggestions

### Command Palette
- Add Cmd+K command palette
- Commands: "assign", "create", "move", "find", "status"
- AI interprets natural language: "move my tasks to done"

### Dashboard Improvements
- Real-time agent workload bars
- Bottleneck alerts (tasks waiting >1hr)
- One-click rebalancing button

### Bulk Operations
- Multi-select with shift-click
- "Assign all unassigned to X"
- "Move all done to archived"

## If You Were My Chief of Staff

### Daily Frustrations
- No way to see "what needs my attention NOW"
- Switching between tabs to check status
- Manual task assignment takes too many clicks

### What Would Make Me 2x More Effective
- Real-time Slack/Discord bot integration
- Auto-daily briefing: "You have X tasks, Y blocked, Z done"
- One-click agent spawn for new work types
